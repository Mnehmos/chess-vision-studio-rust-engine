"""Source-split + determinism guards for promotion-eligible gen9 training (#13).

Ported from the reviewed app-repo counterpart (chess-vision-studio #33); shared, identical logic.
The gen9 trainers (train-cvs-residual.py, train_matrix.py) historically derived a *position-level*
holdout inside the trainer
(`hold = (np.arange(n) % 50) == 7`) over a single unsplit corpus. That leaks sibling positions
from the same game/source into both train and holdout, which invalidates P-EVAL-K/P-EVAL-C capacity
and corpus comparisons. Training was also unseeded, so artifacts were not reproducible.

This module provides the two invariants a promotion-eligible run must enforce BEFORE training:

  1. NO SOURCE LEAKAGE (INV-3): every train row and every holdout (validation/test) row must carry a
     stable source/game key, and NO key may appear in both train and holdout. The key is
     splitKey-first (matching rust-engine #9 `lint_corpus`), then `source.sourceId`/`source.gameId`;
     there is NO FEN fallback (a FEN is a position, not a source identity). Rows lacking a key FAIL
     CLOSED — we cannot prove non-leakage for an unkeyed row.
  2. DETERMINISM: a single integer seed seeds random / numpy / torch so runs are reproducible enough
     for controlled probes. Exact GPU bit-reproducibility is NOT guaranteed (torch EmbeddingBag
     backward uses non-deterministic CUDA atomic scatter); declare multiple seeds for variance.

Pure-Python; numpy/torch are imported lazily (and ImportError-guarded) inside `seed_everything`, so
this module imports and tests without the training stack.

    The 'sid/gid' join (and the bare-gameId fallback) is delimiter-ambiguous, so distinct sources
    CAN collide on one key — but that only OVER-refuses (flags two different sources as a leak); it
